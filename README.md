Project Title: Flutter App with REST API Integration and Local Storage using Sqflite

Project Description:

This Flutter project involves creating a mobile application that interacts with a backend server to fetch data via a REST API and stores the retrieved data locally using the Sqflite plugin. The main components of the project include:

REST API Integration:

Used an http package to make HTTP requests to a backend server.
Fetch data from various endpoints and handle JSON responses.
Implement error handling for network requests, including timeouts and retries.

Local Storage with Sqflite:

Used an sqflite package to store data locally on the device.
Created and managed SQLite databases, including defining tables and columns.
Performed CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the local database.
Ensured data synchronization between the local database and the backend server.

State Management:

Implemented state management to handle data flow within the app.
Used an providers for state management solutions to manage the app's state effectively.


Technologies and Tools:

http package: Used for making HTTP requests to the REST API.
Sqflite package: Used for local database storage using SQLite.
Provider: Used for managing the state of the application.

Key Features:
